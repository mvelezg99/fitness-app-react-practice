# Fitness App
***

**FitnessApp** is a backend and frontend project to practice **React**.

This practice comes from the course ["Curso de ReactJS"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIddmSRJEJ0vEBB6ECegg35IQ-sWjSDdo) made by Raul Palacios in YouTube.

The objective of this project is to practice ***ReactJs*** making use of its different features to know how to incorporate this library into our applications.
